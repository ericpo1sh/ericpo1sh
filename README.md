### Hi there my name is Eric Dzyk ðŸ‘‹
Hi, I am a programming student at Atlas School in downtown Tulsa, OK. Ever since I was small, I was always curious about how things are made. My curiosity with coding started off when I was young and playing video games, I would be using/writing my own exploits and applying it to the game that I played, that's when everything just fell into place and I knew that I wanted to have a career in programming. 

I am a tech driven individual who is always up-to-date on the newest trends and technology. I am a people person and I am very easy to talk to. I love to work both in a group and by myself. My goal is to express my ideas and turn them into reality through code!
